Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is caused by the plugin "@netlify/angular-runtime" being unable to locate the angular.json/nx.json file at the project root or two levels above the publish directory.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the angular.json file is present in the root of your project or two levels above the publish directory.
2. If the file is present and committed to the repo, ensure that it is correctly named as angular.json.
3. If the file is missing, add the angular.json file to the root of your project or two levels above the publish directory.

Following these steps should resolve the error related to the missing angular.json/nx.json file.
