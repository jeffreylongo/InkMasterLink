Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to a plugin error related to "@netlify/angular-runtime". The error message indicates that the plugin could not locate "angular.json" or "nx.json" at the project root or two levels above the publish directory.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that "angular.json" or "nx.json" exists at the project root or two levels above the publish directory.
2. Make sure that the configuration files are correctly placed or adjust the plugin settings to point to the correct location of these files to resolve the issue.
