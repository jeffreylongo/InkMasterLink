    <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Every artist has their own recommendations based on your tattoo’s style, size, and location. Always <strong>follow the specific aftercare advice</strong> given by your artist.</p>

    <h2>Week 1: The Raw Stage</h2>
    <p>Your tattoo will likely feel like a fresh scrape or sunburn. It may ooze plasma or ink, and redness is normal. Gently wash and moisturize as directed by your artist. Avoid touching it or exposing it to direct sunlight.</p>

    <h2>Week 2: The Peeling Begins</h2>
    <p>Flaking and scabbing will start. This is when the itching can become intense — <strong>resist the urge to scratch!</strong> Apply a thin layer of fragrance-free lotion and let flakes fall off naturally.</p>

    <h2>Week 3: Things Settle Down</h2>
    <p>Scabs will be gone or mostly gone. Your skin might appear shiny or slightly dull. It’s still healing underneath, so continue to moisturize and be gentle with it.</p>

    <h2>Week 4 and Beyond: Final Stages</h2>
    <p>The outer skin is mostly healed, but deeper layers may still be repairing. Your tattoo will begin to show its true clarity and detail. You can resume normal activities, but keep it protected in sun or rough environments.</p>

    <p><strong>Healing times vary</strong> based on body part, design complexity, and skin type. When in doubt, contact your artist — they’ll know how your tattoo should be progressing.</p>
