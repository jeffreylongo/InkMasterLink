    <p>Choosing where to get tattooed is just as important as the design itself. A clean, professional environment and a great artist can make all the difference. Here's what to look for when picking a tattoo shop — and remember, <strong>your artist’s advice always comes first</strong>.</p>

    <h2>1. Cleanliness and Safety</h2>
    <p>The shop should look and smell clean. Artists should wear gloves, use disposable needles, and open fresh ink in front of you. Don’t be afraid to ask about sterilization practices.</p>

    <h2>2. Portfolios and Style</h2>
    <p>Every artist has a unique style. Look through their past work (on the walls or Instagram) to make sure their strengths align with what you want. Don’t assume all artists do all styles equally well.</p>

    <h2>3. Vibe and Professionalism</h2>
    <p>You should feel comfortable asking questions and discussing your idea. A good shop is welcoming, not intimidating. Trust your gut — if something feels off, it’s okay to walk away.</p>

    <h2>4. Reviews and Recommendations</h2>
    <p>Word of mouth matters. Ask friends, check Google, Yelp, and Instagram comments. Look for consistent praise, especially about cleanliness, friendliness, and professionalism.</p>

    <h2>5. Artist Consultations</h2>
    <p>Many artists offer free or low-cost consultations. Use this time to ask about aftercare, pain expectations, and healing. It’s also your chance to get a sense of whether you click with them.</p>

    <p><strong>Final tip:</strong> Listen to the artist once you’ve chosen them. They want your tattoo to heal well and look great long-term, so follow their preferences over generic internet advice.</p>
