    <p>Getting your first tattoo can be an exciting and meaningful experience — but it's also permanent. Before you commit, ask yourself these five essential questions. And as always, <strong>talk to your tattoo artist</strong> during the consultation. They can offer specific advice based on your idea and your body.</p>

    <h2>1. Why Do I Want This Tattoo?</h2>
    <p>Make sure your tattoo has meaning to you — whether personal, symbolic, or simply aesthetic. Regret often stems from rushed decisions or peer pressure. A design you’re confident in today is more likely to stand the test of time.</p>

    <h2>2. Who Is the Artist?</h2>
    <p>Do your research. Look at portfolios, check social media, and read reviews. Every artist has a style — make sure it matches what you’re looking for. A great artist will also be open to consultations and talk you through the process.</p>

    <h2>3. Where Do I Want It?</h2>
    <p>Placement affects visibility, pain level, and how your tattoo may age. Spots like ribs, feet, or inner biceps can be more painful. Consider how often you want it seen — and how it may stretch or fade over time.</p>

    <h2>4. Do I Know the Aftercare?</h2>
    <p><strong>Ask your artist for their aftercare instructions</strong>. Healing can take weeks, and proper care prevents infection and keeps the tattoo looking sharp. You'll find plenty of generic advice online, but <strong>listen to your artist</strong> — they know their ink and how they apply it.</p>

    <h2>5. Am I Prepared for the Commitment?</h2>
    <p>Tattoos are permanent. Even small pieces can take hours to complete, and removal is costly and painful. If you're unsure, wait. Good tattoos are worth planning for — and saving for.</p>

    <h2>Final Advice</h2>
    <p>Your artist is your partner in this process. <strong>Don’t hesitate to ask questions</strong>, share ideas, and express any concerns. Most importantly, <strong>trust their guidance when it comes to design, placement, and aftercare</strong>.</p>
