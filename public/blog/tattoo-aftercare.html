    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Always follow the aftercare instructions provided by <em>your own tattoo artist</em>. Every artist has their own techniques and preferences that are tailored to the style of work they've done on your skin.</p>

    <h2>Day 1: The Wrap</h2>
    <p>Once your tattoo is finished, your artist will usually wrap it in plastic or a bandage. This protects it from bacteria and friction while you leave the shop. Follow their guidance on how long to leave it wrapped — typically between 1 and 24 hours.</p>

    <h2>First Wash</h2>
    <p>After removing the wrap, gently wash the area with lukewarm water and fragrance-free soap. Pat it dry with a clean paper towel or let it air dry. Do <em>not</em> scrub or use a washcloth. Again, follow your artist's timeline for when to do this.</p>

    <h2>Moisturizing</h2>
    <p>Use an unscented lotion or tattoo-specific aftercare balm to keep the skin hydrated. Don’t overapply — your tattoo needs to breathe. Your artist might recommend a specific brand or method — always defer to them.</p>

    <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No scratching or picking, even if it itches or flakes.</li>
      <li>Avoid soaking (no baths, swimming, or hot tubs) until it's fully healed.</li>
      <li>Keep it out of the sun — UV exposure can damage and fade the ink.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> These tips are general guidelines. Tattoo aftercare is not one-size-fits-all. Your artist knows your tattoo best — listen to their instructions, even if it differs slightly from what you read online.</p>

    <h2>Signs to Watch</h2>
    <p>Redness, warmth, and slight oozing are normal in the first 24–48 hours. However, if you notice excessive swelling, pus, or prolonged pain, contact your artist or a medical professional.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>A properly healed tattoo starts with proper care. Stay clean, moisturized, and most importantly: <strong>follow your artist's aftercare routine</strong>. When in doubt, reach out to them directly — they want your tattoo to look as good as you do.</p>
