  <main class="about">
    <p><strong>Ink Master Link</strong> was created with a simple goal: to be the best tattoo shop directory in the United States.</p>

    <p>We want to make it easier for canvasses to find the right tattoo shops and artists—whether they're local or traveling across the country. Our platform is built to help you explore by city, state, and rating so you can find trusted artists wherever you are.</p>

    <p>But we’re not stopping there. Our long-term vision includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🔍 Tools for canvasses to discover **traveling artists** and **book guest spots**</li>
      <li>🧳 A platform for artists to **promote themselves**, **find guest work**, and **grow their reach**</li>
      <li>🖋️ Helping fans get tattooed by artists they admire—even if those artists aren’t local</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We believe in connecting great artists with great clients, no matter where they are. Whether you're planning your first tattoo or adding to your sleeve, we're here to help you find the right artist, every time.</p>

    <p><strong>Thank you</strong> for being part of the Ink Master Link journey.</p>
